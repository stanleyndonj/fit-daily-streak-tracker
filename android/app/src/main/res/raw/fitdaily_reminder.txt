This is a placeholder file for the fitdaily_reminder.mp3 audio file.

To complete the notification sound setup, you need to:

1. Create or obtain a notification sound file (MP3, OGG, or WAV format)
2. Name it "fitdaily_reminder.mp3" 
3. Place it in the android/app/src/main/res/raw/ directory
4. Delete this .txt file

The sound file should be:
- Short (1-3 seconds)
- Clear and pleasant
- Appropriate volume level
- Suitable for notification alerts

Example sounds you could use:
- A gentle chime
- A motivational beep sequence
- A fitness-themed sound effect
- A simple bell tone

Once you add the audio file, the app will use it as the default notification sound.
